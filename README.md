# NFL MVP Predictor Hub
MVPHUB is an interactive web application that combines machine learning with conversational AI to predict NFL MVP winners. Built with a Flask backend and Next.js frontend, this tool features a predictive model with 87% accuracy across the past seven seasons and an intelligent chatbot that provides personalized insights. Users input quarterback statistics through an intuitive form with tooltips and examples, then receive instant MVP probability predictions along with detailed explanations comparing their inputs to elite performance benchmarks.

The application's standout feature is its AI-powered chat assistant that uses Josh Allen's 2024 MVP season as a baseline for comparison and improvement suggestions. When users ask questions like "How can I improve?" or "Why is my prediction low?", the chatbot leverages both local analysis and OpenAI's GPT models to provide contextual, conversational responses. The system intelligently routes technical questions to its built-in explainer while using AI enhancement for more engaging user interactions, creating an educational experience that helps users understand what makes an MVP-caliber quarterback season.
